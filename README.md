<b><h2>NTRODUCTION</b></h2>
This is a Power BI project on **Sales Performance from Maven Market** In this Power BI project, I explored how to optimize production performance in a Sales performance from Maven Market . I created a dashboard and a report that display key production metrics, , quality, and efficiency, across different dimensions, such as product year, Total revenue, total transaction. The goal of this project was to provide management with insights, monitor and analyze production performance, detect and resolve issues, and make data-driven decisions to improve operations. I did this project to enhance my skills in data analysis and visualization using Power BI.

# <h3>Note: This project was a challenge from a community called Techitgirls and data was gotten from maveven Market</h3>
